# Dockit - Dolphie
This is the Dockit Dolphie image. It simply runs Dolphie. See the Dolphi docs [here](https://github.com/charles-001/dolphie) for more information.

The image is intended to be use with the current directory synced with the container into the `/app` directory, which is the default working directory.
